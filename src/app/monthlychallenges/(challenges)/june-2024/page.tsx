			<p className="lead">
				This month, we're doing a "Mid-Year Check-In" to provide you with the
				opportunity to reflect on your progress, reevaluate your goals, and gain

			<h2>Theme</h2>
			<p>Mid-Year Check-In!</p>

			<h2>Goals</h2>
			<p>
				Our goal is for you to reflect on your progress, reevaluate your goals,
				and gain clarity on the path you set out on at the beginning of the
				year.
			</p>

			<h2>Who can participate?</h2>
			<p>
				Virtual Coffee's goal is to support all developers, no matter where they
				are in their coding journey. We encourage all members to participate.
			</p>

			<h2>How it works</h2>
			<h3>Reflect, Reevaluate, and Move Forward</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Reflect on achievements</strong>: Think about your goals set
					at the beginning (or any point) this year. What have you accomplished
					so far? Did you master a new skill, hit a personal target, or complete
					a project?
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learn from challenges</strong>: Did you encounter any setbacks
					or roadblocks? It's okay! Analyze what went wrong. Was it a lack of
					resources, an unexpected hurdle, or an underestimation of the effort
					needed?
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Set your sights forward</strong>: What are your remaining
					goals for the year? Are there any adjustments you want to make based
					on your progress?
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Embrace shifting goals</strong>: It's okay if your goals have
					changed! Your priorities and circumstances can shift throughout the
					year. Embrace the change, revisit your initial goals, and adjust your
					goals accordingly.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 className="mb-3">
				What if I need help and want to hold myself accountable?
