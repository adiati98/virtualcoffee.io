			<h3>What kind of content counts towards the challenge?</h3>

			<p>
				Any tech-related blog posts or articles published in the month of
				November! Feel free to include code samples in your word count totals
				(if it's a word and you wrote it, we'll count it üòä).
			</p>

			<p>
				While we love good documentation here at Virtual Coffee, README docs or
				anything else you would normally consider documentation don't count for
				this challenge.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since last year, we're embracing an <strong>official topic</strong> as
				well as general topics. We hope to add a resource section to our site
				for Building Your Personal Brand. We'd love to feature our members' blog
				posts on the topic.
			</p>

			<h3>What if I'm not confident about my writing?</h3>

			<p>
				We all start somewhere. The more you practice, the better you'll get. We
				have volunteers who are willing to proofread and give you feedback on
				your writing. Just put a link to your blog post draft in the{' '}
				<code>#monthly-challenge</code> channel and ask for the help you need.
			</p>

			<h3>What if I don't know what to write about?</h3>

				We've got you covered with extensive lists in{' '}
