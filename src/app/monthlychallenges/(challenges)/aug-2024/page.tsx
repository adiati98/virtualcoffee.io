				<small>Monthly Challenge for August 2024:</small> Photography Challenge
			</h1>

			<p>We're excited to announce this new challenge for August 2024!</p>

			<p className="lead mt-3">
				This month, we are encouraging our members to take some time away from
				their screens and get out of the house, then come back and share
				photographs in Slack. You can, of course, complete the challenge without
				going more than five feet from your car, but we encourage you to get the
				benefit of some fresh air and exercise.
			</p>

			<h2 className="mt-5">How to Participate</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Plan:</strong> Choose some places to visit outside your home.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Go:</strong> Visit them, and while you’re there, take
					photographs of your surroundings. Include a selfie if you want, but
					the main idea is to photograph the places you visit.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Post:</strong> When you get back, post your photographs in the
					<code> #monthly-challenge</code> channel in Slack. Or you can post
					them on your phone while you’re out if you’re too impatient to wait!
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Browse:</strong> Admire everyone else’s photographs
				</li>
			</ul>
